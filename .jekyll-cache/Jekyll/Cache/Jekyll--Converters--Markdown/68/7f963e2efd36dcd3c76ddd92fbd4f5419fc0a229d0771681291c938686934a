<p>Higurashi no naku koro ni gou (2020) is NOT a remake. They are in another world fragment. So in the first episode, no one will expect that 
the arc was Onidamashi-hen. It went 100% just like Onikakushi. The first scene there was also the first scene in Onikakushi-hen. Yeah, the scene
where Keiichi beat the fuck up of Rena and Mion with his (Satoshiâ€™s actually) baseball bat. Everything then went dark and the anime turns into
a mf slice of life</p>

<p>Every newcomers and veterans (Fans of the original higurashi) will think that this is a remake, and veterans would be able to tell what will happened
in the end. But everything went weird in the second episode. But guess what? In the second episode, They fuckinâ€™ showed Rika met with Hanyuu on one of the world fragments.</p>

<p>For both newcomers and Veterans, this is super confusing. From this scene i can conclude that this is a whole new arc, but based on Onikakushiâ€¦ Wellâ€¦ only the first episode,
The funny thing is Ryukishi07 said that gou will be newcomers friendly. Holy shit dude you are a great troll. Alright, letâ€™s get to the next major event.</p>
