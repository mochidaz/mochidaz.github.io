<p>Watadamashi-hen is the second question arc in Higurashi no naku koro ni Gou based on Watanagashi-hen. If youâ€™re a veteran, then you will know whoâ€™s the actual murderer in Watanagashi-hen and what event triggered it. Yes, when Keiichi gave the doll he got to Rena in Watanagashi-hen.</p>

<p>Here, Mionâ€™s feeling was hurt and she told about that to her sister, Shion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/watadamashi3.jpg" alt="watadamashi3" /></p>

<p>That made Shion remembered her feelings when Satoshi disappeared a long time ago.</p>

<p>And yeah, Shion then went nuts and slaughtered everyone. But before that, letâ€™s remember that Shion wanted to go to the sacred warehouse. She thought that if she goes there, she would be able to know how Satoshi disappeared. It happened again in Watadamashi-hen.</p>

<p>However, whatâ€™s shocking is, Keiichi gave the doll to Rena in the first episode of Watadamashi-hen.</p>

<p>But why did Shion still want to see whatâ€™s inside the warehouse, and she also brought Keiichi with her? That only happened if Keiichi gave the doll to Rena and not Mion. Shion brought Keiichi so that when Mion finds out that they entered the warehouse, Mion will let them go. Did the â€œUnlike Mionâ€™s, Shion has a sweet smileâ€ sentence was the one that triggered the event? No idea. I really canâ€™t wait for the next episode.</p>
