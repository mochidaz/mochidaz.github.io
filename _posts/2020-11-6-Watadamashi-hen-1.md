Watadamashi-hen is the second question arc in Higurashi no naku koro ni Gou based on Watanagashi-hen. If you're a veteran, then you will know who's the actual murderer in Watanagashi-hen and what event triggered it. Yes, when Keiichi gave the doll he got to Rena in Watanagashi-hen.

Here, Mion's feeling was hurt and she told about that to her sister, Shion.

That made Shion remembered her feelings when Satoshi disappeared a long time ago.

And yeah, Shion then went nuts and slaughtered everyone. But before that, let's remember that Shion wanted to go to the sacred warehouse. She thought that if she goes there, she would be able to know how Satoshi disappeared. It happened again in Watadamashi-hen.

However, what's shocking is, Keiichi gave the doll to Mion in the first episode of Watadamashi-hen.

But why did Shion still want to see what's inside the warehouse, and she also brought Keiichi with her? That only happened if Keiichi gave the doll to Rena and not Mion. Shion brought Keiichi so that when Mion finds out that they entered the warehouse, Mion will let them go. Did the "Unlike Mion's, Shion has a sweet smile" sentence was the one that triggered the event? No idea. I really can't wait for the answer arcs. 70% that Shion will go crazy, and 30%, MION WILL. Gou showed us unexpected shit in Onidamashi-hen before, so it is possible for Mion to becomes crazy as well in this anime. Maybe because of her jealousy to Shion because Keiichi said Shion is cuter, and Shion also teases Keiichi oftenly? Who knows?
