Higurashi no naku koro ni gou (2020) is NOT a remake. They are in another world fragment. So in the first episode, no one will expect that 
the arc was Onidamashi-hen. It went 100% just like Onikakushi. The first scene there was also the first scene in Onikakushi-hen. Yeah, the scene
where Keiichi beat the fuck up of Rena and Mion with his (Satoshi's actually) baseball bat. Everything then went dark and the anime turns into
a mf slice of life

Every newcomers and veterans (Fans of the original higurashi) will think that this is a remake, and veterans would be able to tell what will happened
in the end. But everything went weird in the second episode. But guess what? In the second episode, They fuckin' showed Rika met with Hanyuu on one of the world fragments.

For both newcomers and Veterans, this is super confusing. From this scene i can conclude that this is a whole new arc, but based on Onikakushi... Well... only the first episode,
The funny thing is Ryukishi07 said that gou will be newcomers friendly. Holy shit dude you are a great troll. Alright, let's get to the next major event.

Don't lie to me you were expecting the legendary door scene here.

Yep, in this arc, Keiichi somehow managed to remember Onikakushi and let Rena enter his house (Huge mistake). Rika told him that he was the one who made Rena
scary. Keiichi's mom asked Rena to cook and come to their house to bring a dinner for Keiichi. But well...

And then the cringefest begin. Gory scene that made veterans cringed to their assess. Like yo, this ain't the psychological horror i wanted.

But that was confusing af. Like, who the hell hallucinated this time? There are so many theories and you can find mine too [here](https://whentheycry.fandom.com/wiki/Onidamashi-hen) in the comment section.

I rate this arc 6/10. There aren't really disturbing scenes that made my psychologically disturbed like onigiri needle scene, door scene, and when Mion injected something to Keiichi
(Which actually just Keiichi's hallucination).
